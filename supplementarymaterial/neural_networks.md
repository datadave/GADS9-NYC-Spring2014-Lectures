Neural Networks
============

Neural Networks are a learning paradigm inspired by our animal brains (like yours!) that can be utilized for all three branches of machine learning -- supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement. They  are one approach to machine learning that attempts to deal with the problem of large data dimensionality.

## Overview

In computer science and related fields, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by an animal's central nervous systems (in particular the brain) which is capable of machine learning as well as pattern recognition. Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems of interconnected "neurons" which can compute values from inputs.

For example, a neural network for handwriting recognition is defined by a set of input neurons which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. The activations of these neurons are then passed on, weighted and transformed by a function determined by the network's designer, to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated. This determines which character was read.

Like other machine learning methods, systems that learn from data, neural networks have been used to solve a wide variety of tasks that are hard to solve using ordinary rule-based programming, including computer vision and speech recognition. _[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)_
